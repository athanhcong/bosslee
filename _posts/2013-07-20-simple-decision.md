> When I got out of college I knew nothing about software development. My entire college education prepared me to be a Chemical Engineer, but now I wanted to start a software company.
So every night and weekend, for years, I just kept at it, training myself to develop software.

I spent 3 years in NUS doing business studies. After graduation, many of my friends chose the corporate route while I chose startup life and now I'm developing apps that solved my own problems. It's funny how life can change based on simple decision.
