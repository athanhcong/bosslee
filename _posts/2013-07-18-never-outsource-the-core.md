> Startups never should outsource their main advantage or the skill required to win in the market. If a team of founders believes product design will revolutionize mobile social networking, the team would blunder to outsource that design. Instead, the startup must cultivate a team to master that discipline.

Do one thing well and do one thing good. As our team grows, sometime we start to take on things that are not within our core and we start losing focus. Despite all the talk about focus, it is really not easy to achieve it. When things get heavy or too much for a team, a great alternative is to outsource the non-critical element of your business.
